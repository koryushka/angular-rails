        <p>Hi {{ proposal.customer }},</p>


        <p>It was a pleasure getting to meet with you and review your project requirements, I believe it is a great fit for the types of applications that I build out. Please feel free to check out some of my past projects <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}">here</a>.</p>


        <p>To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing {{ proposal.tools }}, and a number of other tools to ensure that the project follows industry wide best practices.</p>


        <p>Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating everything that we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard and sending you a project update message daily so that you can have a transparent view of the development as it takes place.</p>


        <p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed, I am estimating that it will take {{ proposal.estimated_hours }} hours in development time to complete. The project should take {{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks to complete and with my hourly rate of {{ proposal.hourly_rate }}/hour, the estimated total will be {{proposal.hourly_rate * proposal.estimated_hours | currency:'USD':true:'.0'}}.</p>


        <p>The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the project and sign contracts.</p>


        <p>I am excited to working with you and build out this project.</p>
